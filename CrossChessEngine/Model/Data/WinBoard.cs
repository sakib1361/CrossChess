                     * Chess Engine Communication Protocol
                        ping (boolean, default 0, recommended 1) 
                        If ping=1, xboard may use the protocol's new "ping" command; if ping=0, xboard will not use the command. 
                        setboard (boolean, default 0, recommended 1) 
                        If setboard=1, xboard will use the protocol's new "setboard" command to set up positions; if setboard=0, it will use the older "edit" command. 
                        playother (boolean, default 0, recommended 1) 
                        If playother=1, xboard will use the protocol's new "playother" command when appropriate; if playother=0, it will not use the command. 
                        san (boolean, default 0) 
                        If san=1, xboard will send moves to the engine in standard algebraic notation (SAN); for example, Nf3. If san=0, xboard will send moves in coordinate notation; for example, g1f3. See MOVE in section 8 above for more details of both kinds of notation. 
                        usermove (boolean, default 0) 
                        If usermove=1, xboard will send moves to the engine with the command "usermove MOVE"; if usermove=0, xboard will send just the move, with no command name. 
                        time (boolean, default 1, recommended 1) 
                        If time=1, xboard will send the "time" and "otim" commands to update the engine's clocks; if time=0, it will not. 
                        draw (boolean, default 1, recommended 1) 
                        If draw=1, xboard will send the "draw" command if the engine's opponent offers a draw; if draw=0, xboard will not inform the engine about draw offers. Note that if draw=1, you may receive a draw offer while you are on move; if this will cause you to move immediately, you should set draw=0. 
                        sigint (boolean, default 1) 
                        If sigint=1, xboard may send SIGINT (the interrupt signal) to the engine as section 7 above; if sigint=0, it will not. 
                        sigterm (boolean, default 1) 
                        If sigterm=1, xboard may send SIGTERM (the termination signal) to the engine as section 7 above; if sigterm=0, it will not. 
                        reuse (boolean, default 1, recommended 1) 
                        If reuse=1, xboard may reuse your engine for multiple games. If reuse=0 (or if the user has set the -xreuse option on xboard's command line), xboard will kill the engine process after every game and start a fresh process for the next game. 
                        analyze (boolean, default 1, recommended 1) 
                        If analyze=0, xboard will not try to use the "analyze" command; it will pop up an error message if the user asks for analysis mode. If analyze=1, xboard will try to use the command if the user asks for analysis mode. 
                        myname (string, default determined from engine filename) 
                        This feature lets you set the name that xboard will use for your engine in window banners, in the PGN tags of saved game files, and when sending the "name" command to another engine. 
                        variants (string, see text below) 
                        This feature indicates which chess variants your engine accepts. It should be a comma-separated list of variant names. See the table under the "variant" command in section 8 above. If you do not set this feature, xboard will assume by default that your engine supports all variants. (However, the -zippyVariants command-line option still limits which variants will be accepted in Zippy mode.) It is recommended that you set this feature to the correct value for your engine (just "normal" in most cases) rather than leaving the default in place, so that the user will get an appropriate error message if he tries to play a variant that your engine does not support. 
                        colors (boolean, default 1, recommended 0) 
                        If colors=1, xboard uses the obsolete "white" and "black" commands in a stylized way that works with most older chess engines that require the commands. See the "Idioms" section below for details. If colors=0, xboard does not use the "white" and "black" commands at all. 
                        ics (boolean, default 0) 
                        If ics=1, xboard will use the protocol's new "ics" command to inform the engine of whether or not it is playing on a chess server; if ics=0, it will not. 
                        name (boolean, see text below) 
                        If name=1, xboard will use the protocol's "name" command to inform the engine of the opponent's name; if name=0, it will not. By default, name=1 if the engine is playing on a chess server; name=0 if not. 
                        pause (boolean, default 0) 
                        If pause=1, xboard may use the protocol's new "pause" command; if pause=0, xboard assumes that the engine does not support this command. 
                        done (integer, no default) 
                        If you set done=1 during the initial two-second timeout after xboard sends you the "xboard" command, the timeout will end and xboard will not look for any more feature commands before starting normal operation. If you set done=0, the initial timeout is increased to one hour; in this case, you must set done=1 before xboard will enter normal operation.

                        if you receive a ping while pondering, you should reply immediately and continue pondering. Because 
                        of the way xboard uses the ping command, if you implement the other commands in this protocol, you 
                        should never see a "ping" command when it is your move; however, if you do, you must not send the 
                        "pong" reply to xboard until after you send your move. For example, xboard may send "?" immediately 
                        followed by "ping". If you implement the "?" command, you will have moved by the time you see the 
                        subsequent ping command. Similarly, xboard may send a sequence like "force", "new", "ping". You must 
                        not send the pong response until after you have finished executing the "new" command and are ready 
                        for the new game to start. The ping command is new in protocol version 2 and will not be sent unless 
                        you enable it with the "feature" command. Its purpose is to allow several race conditions that could 
                        occur in previous versions of the protocol to be fixed, so it is highly recommended that you implement 
                        it. It is especially important in simple engines that do not ponder and do not poll for input while 
                        thinking, but it is needed in all engines.

                        After the end of each game, xboard will send you a result command. You can use this command to trigger learning. RESULT is either 1-0, 0-1, 1/2-1/2, or *, indicating whether white won, black won, the game was a draw, or the game was unfinished. The COMMENT string is purely a human-readable comment; its content is unspecified and subject to change. In ICS mode, it is passed through from ICS uninterpreted. Example: 
                        result 1-0 {White mates}
                        Here are some notes on interpreting the "result" command. Some apply only to playing on ICS ("Zippy" mode). 

                        If you won but did not just play a mate, your opponent must have resigned or forfeited. If you lost but were not just mated, you probably forfeited on time, or perhaps the operator resigned manually. If there was a draw for some nonobvious reason, perhaps your opponent called your flag when he had insufficient mating material (or vice versa), or perhaps the operator agreed to a draw manually. 

                        You will get a result command even if you already know the game ended -- for example, after you just checkmated your opponent. In fact, if you send the "RESULT {COMMENT}" command (discussed below), you will simply get the same thing fed back to you with "result" tacked in front. You might not always get a "result *" command, however. In particular, you won't get one in local chess engine mode when the user stops playing by selecting Reset, Edit Game, Exit or the like.

                        The edit command is the old way to set up positions. For compatibility with old engines, it is still used by default, but new engines may prefer to use the feature command (see below) to cause xboard to use setboard instead. The edit command puts the chess engine into a special mode, where it accepts the following subcommands: c change current piece color, initially white  
                        Pa4 (for example) place pawn of current color on a4  
                        xa4 (for example) empty the square a4 (not used by xboard)  
                        # clear board  
                        . leave edit mode  
                        See the Idioms section below for additional subcommands used in ChessBase's implementation of the protocol. 
                        The edit command does not change the side to move. To set up a black-on-move position, xboard uses the following command sequence: 

                            new
                            force
                            a2a3

                            <edit commands>
                            .

                        This sequence is used to avoid the "black" command, which is now considered obsolete and which many engines never did implement as specified in this document. 

                        After an edit command is complete, if a king and a rook are on their home squares, castling is assumed to be available to them. En passant capture is assumed to be illegal on the current move regardless of the positions of the pawns. The clock for the 50 move rule starts at zero, and for purposes of the draw by repetition rule, no prior positions are deemed to have occurred.

If not in force mode, stop the opponent's clock, start the engine's clock, start thinking, and eventually make a move. 
                    When xboard sends your engine a move, it normally sends coordinate algebraic notation. Examples: 

                    Normal moves: e2e4  
                    Pawn promotion: e7e8q  
                    Castling: e1g1, e1c1, e8g8, e8c8  
                    Bughouse/crazyhouse drop: P@h3  
                    ICS Wild 0/1 castling: d1f1, d1b1, d8f8, d8b8  
                    FischerRandom castling: O-O, O-O-O (oh, not zero)  

                    Beginning in protocol version 2, you can use the feature command to select SAN (standard algebraic notation) instead; for example, e4, Nf3, exd5, Bxf7+, Qxf7#, e8=Q, O-O, or P@h3. Note that the last form, P@h3, is a extension to the PGN standard's definition of SAN, which does not support bughouse or crazyhouse. 

                    xboard doesn't reliably detect illegal moves, because it does not keep track of castling unavailability due to king or rook moves, or en passant availability. If xboard sends an illegal move, send back an error message so that xboard can retract it and inform the user; see the section "Commands from the engine to xboard".

                After 12.34 seconds, I've searched 7 ply/30000 nodes, there are a total of 30 legal moves, and I have 5 more moves to search before going to depth 8. In the second example, of the 30 legal moves, the one I am currently searching is Nf3.

                In conventional clock mode, every time control period is the same. That is, if the time control is 
                40 moves in 5 minutes, then after each side has made 40 moves, they each get an additional 5 minutes, 
                and so on, ad infinitum. At some future time it would be nice to support a series of distinct time 
                controls. This is very low on my personal priority list, but code donations to the xboard project 
                are accepted, so feel free to take a swing at it. I suggest you talk to me first, though. 

                The command to set a conventional time control looks like this: 

                level 40 5 0
                level 40 0:30 0

                The 40 means that there are 40 moves per time control. The 5 means there are 5 minutes in the control. In the second example, the 0:30 means there are 30 seconds. The final 0 means that we are in conventional clock mode.
